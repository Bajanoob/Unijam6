# KORO
KORO is a game made by three artists and three programmers pitched during UNIJAM 2017. The event gathered over ten student teams to bring a game to life over 48 hours. Each game had to follow the theme of the event, a quote by Hirokazu KOBAYASHI :
	"If your life is not fulfilling, change it. If you can't change it, change yourself".
	
# Features
The game features a humanoid character called Koro in a side scrolling 2D platformer. The gameplay twist involves the character being able to use the health bar above its head as a physical component in the world, eg. as a shield from dangerous objects or a platform to reach over pits and tall obstacles. Be wary! This means the health bar gets harder to use if the character gets hurt, as the health bar shrinks.
The player can also switch Koro's physical form to an alternate character which uses heart units as an indicator of health instead of the classic health bar. This unlocks the capability of throwing said hearts as projectiles to be used in various puzzles.

The game used the Unity engine for all physics, gameplay and animation features.
